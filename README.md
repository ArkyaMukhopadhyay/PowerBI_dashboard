Project Title: E-Commerce Sales Dashboard
Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard titled "E-Commerce Sales Dashboard" using two separate datasets:

Orders CSV: Included order ID, customer name, order date, and shipping details.

Details CSV: Contained product category, profit, sales, quantity, and discount information.

The objective was to analyze key business metrics such as total sales, profit trends, high-performing product categories, and customer segmentation. Merged the two datasets using Power BIâ€™s data modeling capabilities and built relationships to ensure seamless cross-filtering and dynamic reporting.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Dynamic filters for region, customer, category, and order status.

KPI cards for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Average Discount.

Bar and line charts showing sales and profit trends over time.

Category-level insights to identify best-selling and least profitable segments.

Implemented DAX measures for calculating performance metrics and Power Query transformations for data cleaning and formatting.

The dashboard enabled stakeholders to gain actionable insights into e-commerce performance and make informed decisions on inventory, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.
